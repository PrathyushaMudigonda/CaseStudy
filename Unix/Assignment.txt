Exercise-1

1.Create folder 'Test' in your home directory
mkdir Test


2.Create below files
  - employeelist
  - skillset
touch employeelist skillset


3.Create folder Test2 in home directory
mkdir Test2

- create symbolink and hard link for skillset file 
 ln skillset hardlink      ln -s skillset symlink

- delete skillset file and check if hardlink and symbolic link file exists
 rm skillset

- explain the difference b/n symbolic and hard links
Symbolic link is an actual link to the original file.
Hard link is a mirror copy of original file.

 
4.Provide read and write permission to 'user2' group
sudo chgrp user2 skillset
chmod g+rw skillset

test if user2 group users can access the file
yes


5.Revoke write permission from user2 group and test the access again
chmod g-w skillset


6.Grant write permission for others and test it 
chmod o+w skillset


7.Revoke write permission for others and test again
chmod o-w skillset


8.. Change the group of employeelist file to 'user3'
sudo chgrp user3 employeelist

test if user3 group have access
yes


9.Change ownership of the file to user5 and test
sudo chown user5 employeelist


10.. check how many employees are there  (hint: use wc command)
wc -l employeelist



Exercise-2

1.Create file “File1”
touch File1


2.Append 2 more lines to the same file
cat file1
cat file1 >>File1


3.Create File2 with few lines
cat >>File2


4.Display the contents of both File1 and File2
cat File1 File2


5.Concatenate both File1 & 2 and Send the above output to File3
cat File1 File2 &>File3


6.Read File1,File2,File3… File5 . Observe the output
cat File1 File2 File3 File4 File5
It will display the contents of the files which are present and also error messages for the files which are not present.


7.Redirect the errors of the above command to “errorlog”
cat File1 File2 File3 File4 File5 2>/dev/null


8.Concatenate name File1 to 5 and store it in File 10. if any errors, log them in the same file 
cat File1 File2 File3 File4 File5 &>File10


9.Copy File1 to File6. Add the errors to “errorlog”
cp File1 File6 2>/dev/null



Exercise-3

1.The 10th to 25th  lines in a file
head -25 f2 | tail -16


2.List only 10th line in a file
head -10 f2 |tail -1


3.List only the recently modified file in the current directory
find . -mtime -24 -print


4.List only the smallest file in the current directory
ls -lSr | head -2



Exercise-4

1.Lines containing A
ls|grep "A"


2.lines containing The at the beginning
ls|grep ^The


3.lines  ending with  .	
ls|grep [.]$


4.lines with a,b or c as the second letter
ls|grep ^.[a-c]


5.lines which contain def , deef or deeeef 
ls|grep ^*de*f$


6.lines not having numbers at the beginning
ls |grep -v ^[0-9]


7.empty lines
grep ^$ f3


8.list the password file details of user1 - user10
grep ^user[0-9] /etc/passwd | head -10


9.list only directories
ls -l|grep ^d



Exercise-5

1.Create a file which contains long listing of the files in root directory
ls -li ../../ >sorfile


2.Sort the file based on the filename descending order (last field)
sort -rk 10 sorfile


3.Sort the file based only on the inode count
sort -nk 1 sorfile


4.Sort the file based on the user name and group name in reverse order
sort -k 4,5 sorfile


5.Sort the file based on the file size and store the output in a file called sorted file
sort -nk 6 sorfile >sortedfile



Exercise-6

1.Run a sleep command of a large file at the background
sleep 100 &


2.Run a sort command of a large file at the background using nohup
nohup sleep 10 &


3.Check what happens when you log off for the above
When we execute the sleep command and logoff then the process is terminated.
when we execute the nohup command and logoff then the process is executed and will be there in PID.


4.Write a command that sleeps for 5 seconds and then prints hello
sleep 5 & echo "Hello"



Exercise-7
